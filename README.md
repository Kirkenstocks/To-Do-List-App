# To-Do-List-App

##Description
This is a simple to-do list app created to practice using jQuery. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery 3.5.1. The user can add items to the list via an add button, cross out items by double-clicking them, delete items by pressing the "X" button next to it, and sort items by dragging and dropping them.

##Credits
This app was created for the CareerFoundry full-stack immersion program. The HTML and CSS were written and provided to students by CareerFoundry. The initial JavaScript code was also written by CareerFoundry, and then replaced with the equivalent jQuery code by me while retaining all original functionality.
